Hubbub is an HTML5 compliant parsing library, written in C. It was
developed as part of the NetSurf project and is available for use by other
software under the MIT licence.

The HTML5 specification defines a parsing algorithm, based on the behaviour
of mainstream browsers, which provides instructions for how to parse all
markup, both valid and invalid. As a result, Hubbub parses web content
well.
